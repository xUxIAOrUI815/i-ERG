Callbacks are **Python functions** you define and attach to agents - ADK automatically calls them at specific stages, acting like checkpoints during the agent's execution flow.\n\n**Think of callbacks as event listeners in your agent's lifecycle.** When an agent processes a request, it goes through multiple stages: receiving the input, calling the LLM, invoking tools, and generating the response. Callbacks let you insert custom logic at each of these stages without modifying the core agent code.\n\n**Available callback types:**\n\n- `before_agent_callback` → Runs before agent starts processing a request\n- `after_agent_callback` → Runs after agent completes its turn  \n- `before_tool_callback` / `after_tool_callback` → Around tool invocations\n- `before_model_callback` / `after_model_callback` → Around LLM calls\n- `on_model_error_callback` → When errors occur\n\n**Common use cases:**\n\n- Logging and observability (track what the agent does)\n- Automatic data persistence (like saving to memory)\n- Custom validation or filtering\n- Performance monitoring\n\n**📚 Learn More:** [ADK Callbacks Documentation](https://google.github.io/adk-docs/agents/callbacks/)","metadata":{}},{"id":"0695a4a6-a09f-49ed-b6ad-931856cd2b6c","cell_type":"markdown","source":"![image.png](https://storage.googleapis.com/github-repo/kaggle-5days-ai/day4/types_of_callbacks.png)","metadata":{}},{"id":"b8974cc6-d46a-46fa-9ea3-bd4b5e48ea42","cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 6.2 Automatic Memory Storage with Callbacks\n\nFor automatic memory storage, we'll use `after_agent_callback`.
